# AI Machine Learning Practice — Gradient Descent & Closed Form

AI stripped to fundamentals.  
This notebook shows the **essence of machine learning**:  

- **Gradient Descent** — stepwise descent down the cost curve.  
- **Cost Functions** — the map for every move.  
- **Closed Form Solution** — math shortcut, no iterations needed.  
- **Parameter Updates** — where theory meets practice.
